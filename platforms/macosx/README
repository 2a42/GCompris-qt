Look at build.sh to build it.

For now there is a mix of CMake build and QMake build.

The CMake build creates the rcc only.

To test it:
open gcompris.app

This test the installer part but not sure where it goes and how to run it.
sudo installer -store -pkg gcompris.pkg -target /

To upload it, create a new version on itunes connect, then use the 'Application Loader' app to upload it.
